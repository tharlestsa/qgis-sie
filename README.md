# Sentinel Image Explorer (SIE)

## Description

This Python code provides a custom QGIS plugin widget that allows users to interact with time-series images from Sentinel. It includes functionalities like filtering images by date, zooming to a specific point, and a time-lapse feature that plays through the images in time order. Additionally, it includes a Layer Grid view to display small previews of all layers in a grid.

## Features

- Filter Sentinel's images by date range
- Time-lapse playback through the images
- Zoom to a specific point
- Layer Grid for a quick overview
- Play, Stop, and Remove Layers buttons

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have QGIS installed on your system  ([Download](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)).
- Install the lib `satsearch` to search images Sentinel

## Installing satsearch in QGIS Python Environment on Windows

`satsearch` is a Python library for discovering public satellite imagery. This README provides step-by-step instructions for installing `satsearch` within the Python environment used by QGIS on Windows.

### Prerequisites

- Command Prompt with administrative rights

### Steps

#### Step 1: Locate QGIS Python Executable

1. Locate the Python executable associated with your QGIS installation. The path often resembles:

    ```
    C:\Program Files\QGIS XXX\apps\Python39\
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `XXX` with your specific QGIS version number.

#### Step 2: Open Command Prompt as Administrator

1. Navigate to the start menu, search for "Command Prompt", right-click on it and select "Run as administrator".

#### Step 3: Install `satsearch`

1. In the Command Prompt, execute the following command to install `satsearch` using pip. Replace `path_to_qgis_python` with the actual path you found in Step 1.

    ```bash
    C:\path_to_qgis_python\python.exe -m pip install satsearch
    ```

    This will install `satsearch` into the Python environment used by QGIS.

#### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. Verify the installation by executing:

    ```bash
    C:\path_to_qgis_python\python.exe -m pip show satsearch
    ```

    This should display information about the installed package, including its version.

#### Step 5: Import in QGIS

1. You can now use `satsearch` in your QGIS Python scripts as shown below:

    ```python
    from satsearch import Search
    ```

#### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permissions or access rights errors, ensure that you are running the Command Prompt as an administrator.
- If `pip` is not found, it may need to be installed in your QGIS Python environment. Installation methods can vary based on your QGIS version.

## Installing satsearch in QGIS Python Environment on Windows Manually

### Sub-section: Adding `satsearch` and `satstac` to QGIS Python Environment

When you cannot install the `satsearch` and `satstac` packages directly into your QGIS Python environment using package managers like `pip`, you can manually add these libraries. This involves downloading the directories from a specific GitHub repository and then copying them to the appropriate location within the QGIS Python environment.

### Prerequisites

1. You need administrative rights to copy files into `C:\Program Files\QGIS XXX\apps\Python39\Lib`.
2. Internet access to download `satsearch` and `satstac` directories from the GitHub repository.

### Steps

#### 1. Download the Directories

- Go to the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/tharlestsa/qgis-sie](https://github.com/tharlestsa/qgis-sie).
- Download the repository to your local machine, either by using the 'Download ZIP' option or by cloning the repository using Git.

#### 2. Locate the Downloaded Directories

Unzip the downloaded repository and navigate to the location where the `satsearch` and `satstac` folders are stored.

#### 3. Locate the QGIS Python Environment

- Open File Explorer and navigate to the Python environment folder inside your QGIS installation, usually located at `C:\Program Files\QGIS XXX\apps\Python39\Lib`. 
- Here, `XXX` refers to the version of QGIS you have installed.

#### 4. Copy the Directories

- Right-click on the `satsearch` folder and choose `Copy`.
- Navigate back to the `C:\Program Files\QGIS XXX\apps\Python39\Lib` directory.
- Right-click in the folder and choose `Paste` to copy the `satsearch` folder here.

Repeat these steps for the `satstac` folder.

#### 5. Administrative Rights

If prompted, confirm that you have the administrative rights to copy files into this directory.

#### 6. Verify the Installation

To ensure that the libraries are correctly installed, you can open the QGIS Python console and try importing `satsearch` and `satstac` by typing the following commands:

```python
import satsearch
import satstac
```

## Install the Plugin via Python Console

1. Open QGIS.
2. Open the Python Console (`Plugins -> Python Console` or press `Ctrl+Alt+P`).
3. Go to the `Show Editor` tab.
4. Copy-paste the script `sie.py` into the editor and run it.

## Usage

1. Open the widget from your QGIS interface.
2. Use the date filters to set a start and end date for the mosaics.
3. Optionally, enter coordinates to zoom to a specific point.
4. Use the Play button to start a time-lapse through the mosaics.
5. Use the Stop button to stop the time-lapse.
6. Use the Grid button to view a grid of all layers.
7. Use the Remove Layers button to remove all the current layers from the project.
